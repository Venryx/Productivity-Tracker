# Productivity-Tracker
An app I made to help me:
* Keep track of how well I'm meeting my productivity goals, in a visual way.
* Spot patterns in my work-and-rest flow where I could make improvements.
* Motivate me to work harder by means of an easy graph export function. (I share mine weekly)

Other features:
* Easily begin timers for new 'sessions' from the main view, and see them show up on both the timer bar and productivity graph.
* Lock the timer-bar for an open-ended session, pause it if you're leaving for a bit, or stop it to end it completely.
* Configure the name, color, alarm sound, fade-in length, etc. for each session type separately.
* Link a remote device (e.g. bluetooth clicker) up to various actions by way of the hotkey system.

Note: App is designed for use on tablets, and in landscape mode. Till better support is added, it's recommended not to use it on phones or in portrait mode. (it should still work, but will look really bad/stretched)
