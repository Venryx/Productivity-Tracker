# Productivity-Tracker
An app to help:
* Keep track of how well you're meeting your productivity goals, in a visual way.
* Spot patterns in your work-and-rest flow where improvements could be made.
* Motivate you to work harder by means of an easy graph export function. (e.g. for weekly sharing)

Other features:
* Easily begin timers for new 'sessions' from the main view, and have them show up on both the timer bar and productivity graph. (as used for timeboxing/the pomodoro technique)
* Lock the timer-bar for an open-ended session, pause it if you're leaving for a bit, or stop it to end it completely.
* Configure the name, color, alarm sound, fade-in length, etc. for each session type separately.
* Link a remote device (e.g. bluetooth clicker) up to various actions by way of the hotkey system.

Note: App is designed for use on tablets, and in landscape mode. Till better support is added, it's recommended not to use it on phones or in portrait mode. (it should still work, but will look really bad/stretched)
